## Upgrades

### Essential database backups
Ensure you have a local backup of the api-db and keycloak-db before you commence this update. The update of these databases from MariaDB 10.4 to 10.6 should update seamlessly. In the event it does not go smoothly, the image cannot be rolled back owing to incompatible storage engines. You will need to drop the db and restore the backup to get running again.

### Kubernetes 1.21 minimum requirement
The minimum supported version of Kubernetes is 1.21 as of this release.

## Deprecations

There are no required actions or considerations with this release. As always, we suggest upgrading all minor versions.
